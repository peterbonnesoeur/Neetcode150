# The correct approach to solve this kind of problem typically involves using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. In this approach, for each cell that matches the first letter of a word, you start a DFS search to find the remaining letters of the word adjacent to it. Here's a correct approach:

# Iterate through each cell in the board.
# For each cell that matches the first letter of any of the words, perform a DFS to see if the subsequent letters match.
# In the DFS, mark the current cell as visited and explore the four possible directions around the cell (up, down, left, right).
# After each DFS search, backtrack by marking the cell as unvisited.
# If the whole word is found, add it to the result list.
