# Tries:
59 ->  This is a really tricky one.A dfs implementation that can be refined with early stopping mechanism. I had to watch vids about advanced tries for that...

# Backtracking
- 67-subsets
- 69-permutations
- 70=subset-2 -> really tricky as the rule of the exercise are arguably wrong...

# Heap
- 63 - Cooling down ->We need to see the heaps there...
